# Calculator API Challenge

Your challenge is to create a calculator API.

It should be able to add, subtract, multiply and divide any two integers, and return a JSON object with the operation as a string and the result as a number. Attempting to perform any operation outside of these four should return a `404 NOT FOUND` error.
